# pmf-predictions
PMF Predictions is a repository housing my final project for the General Assembly Data Science course. This project aims to predict the SY 2019-20 Performance Management Framework (PMF) tier for DC Public Charter Schools. Due to the effects of COVID-19, it is unlikely a SY 2019-20 score will be issued.
