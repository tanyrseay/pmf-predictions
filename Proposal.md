# Proposal
## Description
Due to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, schools in the District of Columbia (DC) 
will not be taking the statewide assessments in SY 2019-20. This will have a lasting impact on school accountability for DC's
Public Charter School sector. Each year, the DC Public Charter School Board (DC PCSB) publishes the Performance Mangagement Framework (PMF)
which evaluates school quality using a variety of measures. Several of the measures are based on statewide summative assessments. In the absence
of those assessments, it is unlikely a PMF will be published.
## Problem Statement
This project aims to predict what the SY 2019-20 PMF score will be for each charter campus in DC using data from SY 2015-16 to SY 2018-19.
### Hypothesis
Campuses who have had positive trends in overall performance measures for the previous three years will increase in PMF performance in SY 2019-20.
Campuses who have had negative trends in overall performance measures for the previous three years will decrease in PMF performance. 
### Assumptions
Students are currently in a period of distance learning, and we currently do not have a good grasp of what the impact will be on their performance.
This project assumes that learning was uniterrupted and SY 2019-20 is proceeding as a typical school year. 
### Goals and Success Metrics
Schools receiving a score of greater than 65.0% are considered to be Tier 1. Schools receiving a score between 35.0 and 64.9 are considered to be Tier 2.
Schools receiving a score of less than 34.9 are considered Tier 3. This project will be successful if no more than ten campuses fall into a different tier
than the previous school year. On average, we do not see many schools changing tiers each year as one of the key pillars of the PMF is reliability and consistency. 
### Risks of Limitations
One of the limitations is that I must use publicly available data about each campus to create the model. In an idea state, we could use student level data to create the model.
### Relevant Dataset
The first dataset I thought of was something we publish each year. It is a data file of each school year's performance by campus and measure.
I will need to combine SY 2015-16 to SY 2018-19 files for use in this project. An example of the file can be found here: https://dcpcsb.egnyte.com/dl/qMA7aRmfai/
In addition to the academic and demographic data, I will look for other publicly available data that can be incorporated into the file such as financials.
